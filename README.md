# Drone Virtualization and Security Testing

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and experimentation in the realm of drone virtualization and security. The contents are organized into two main folders:

## 1. INAV_Flight_controller

This folder encompasses all the completed work related to the creation of a virtualized environment for drones, along with its individual components. The primary focus here is on establishing a virtualization environment, exploring its components, and testing various security attacks to better understand vulnerabilities.

### Key Highlights:
- Virtualization Environment Setup
- Drone Component Virtualization
- Security Attacks and Vulnerability Assessment

## 2. old_test_PX4

The contents of this folder consist of tests conducted on the PX4 hardware component structure and related elements. It's worth noting that the tests on this specific hardware were not entirely successful. The complexity of splitting the architecture and virtualizing individual components posed challenges that hindered the successful execution of these tests.

### Challenges Encountered:
- Complexity in Splitting Hardware Architecture
- Difficulty in Virtualizing Individual Components

While the tests on PX4 hardware may not have yielded the desired outcomes, the process provided valuable insights into the complexities involved. The learnings from these challenges can potentially contribute to future improvements and developments in the field of drone virtualization and security.
